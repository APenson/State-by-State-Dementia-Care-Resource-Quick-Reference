Resources Chapter: State-by-State Guide and National Contacts
Brief Description
This comprehensive resources chapter serves as a complete directory for families navigating dementia home care across the United States. It's designed to be the "phone book" section of the dementia care guide, providing essential contact information, program details, and navigation guidance for America's complex healthcare system.
The chapter addresses the unique challenge American families face: unlike countries with unified healthcare systems, the U.S. requires navigating multiple federal programs (Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs), state-specific variations, and private insurance options simultaneously.
